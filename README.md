- **Tools:** Google Colab
- **Key Metrics:** Accuracy score of 0.82

## Methodology
- **Data Analysis:** Performed detailed exploration and preprocessing of the dataset.
- **Feature Selection:** Carefully selected features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Development:** Applied the SVM model to predict diabetes presence.
- **Results:** Achieved an accuracy score of 0.82, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in early diabetes detection.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Primary programming language
- **SVM:** Classification model used
- **Google Colab:** Platform for development and testing
